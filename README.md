## URL Bookmark App

# To Do

- The application should be accompanied by a brief TDD (Technical Design Document) outlining the solutionâ€™s design and any limitations.
- Make the links more interesting or funny
- Fix the regex
- Fix link button not working in firefox.
- Make clear a user has to add https://www. or http://www. to the url, or ideally auto-prefix for them!
- Try and figure out not updating the url of the page
- Clean up code and make more DRY/refactor
- Figure out if there is a better architecture to use?
- Comment everything in lots of detail

# Nice to have
- Some kind of unit testing???
- All JavaScript should be compiled into a single minified file using the Google Closure Compiler (using the command line compiler) with advanced optimisations.
- Don't allow someone to post the same URL twice

# Failed
- Where applicable, all code should follow the Google style guidelines.
- Try and validate edited URL addresses.

# Limitations
- Really long URLs on small screens.
