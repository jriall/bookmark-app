## URL Bookmark App

# To Do

- The application should be accompanied by a brief TDD (Technical Design Document) outlining the solutionâ€™s design and any limitations.
- Where applicable, all code should follow the Google style guidelines.
- Make the links more interesting or funny
- Upload to GitHub and GitHub pages
- Add babel or remove ES6 syntax
- Fix the regex
- Try and validate edited URL addresses.
- Fix long URLs for smaller screens
- Fix link button not working in firefox.
- Test in more browsers and screensizes
- Clear all data button plus rename 'reset' button to 'load data'
- Make clear a user has to add https://www. or http://www. to the url, or ideally auto-prefix for them!
- Make code more readable - split the HTML onto new lines
- Split HTML onto new linkes
- Use gh-pages module

# Admin
- Can I use Sass or should I take it out?
- Clean up code and make more DRY/refactor
- Figure out if there is a better architecture to use?
- Comment everything in lots of detail

# Nice to have
- Some kind of unit testing???
- All JavaScript should be compiled into a single minified file using the Google Closure Compiler (using the command line compiler) with advanced optimisations.
- Don't allow someone to post the same URL twice
